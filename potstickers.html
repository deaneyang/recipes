      <h5>Instructions</h5>

      <div class="section">
        <b>Dough</b>

        <p>
          This is the most difficult step, because I don't know the exact amounts or proportions of flour and
          water. The
          goal is to make a dough that is similar in texture to bread dough
          but drier. The trick is to learn by trial and error. Do the rest of
          the steps and see how good the results are and adjust
          accordingly. Also, check to see whether there is too much or too
          little dough and adjust for the next time. In any case, you do
          roughly the following: 
          <ol class="browser-default">
            <li>
              Put the flour in a large mixing bowl.
            </li>
            <li> Add the water and mix first with a wooden spoon and then
              your hands.
            </li>
            <li>Add water or dough according to whether the dough is too wet
              and sticky or too dry. Don't be afraid to switch if you've
              overadjusted one way or another.
            </li>
            <li>Err on the side of being a little too moist, because it's easy to add more flour when you roll out the skins.
            </li>
            <li>Once the dough has the right texture, form into fist-sized balls. Roll with your hands into long cylinders, about an inch in diameter.
              Coat generously with flour.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </div>
      
      <!-- DIVIDER LINE BETWEEN SECTIONS -->
      <div class="divider"></div>

      <div class="section">
        <b>Filling</b>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Put about a quarter of the tofu, all of the garlic, ginger, soy sauce, sesame oil, and whatever else you wantn ingredients into a food processor. Pur\'ee. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour mixture, pork, and vegetables into a large bowl and mix by hand.
          </li>
          <li>
            Taste it (yes, it's raw pork but a little bit won't do any  harm). Add more soy sauce, sesame oil, or salt, according to your taste. It can be left a bit undersalted, since the dipping sauce will add more saltiness.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <b>Skins</b>

        <ol>
          <li>Generously coat a flat dry surface and the rolling pin with flour.</li>
          <li>Cut each cylinder of dough into 1 inch pieces, and reshape each piece into a ball.</li>
          <li>
            Roll each ball into a flat disk. Rotate the disk between 1 or 2 rolls, to keep the shape as close to a circle as you can. As it flattens, put more and more weight onto the rolling pin. The goal is to make a thin round disk. We try to make it as thin as possible but without it tearing easily. This requires the dough to have just the right elasticity. It does not have to be a perfect circle.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the skin starts to fall apart because it's too dry. You'll need to make the rest of the dough by reforming all of it into a single ball, drizzle some water on it, and kneading it a bit. Or consider tossing the dough and start again.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the skin sticks to the rolling pin, then it's too moist. Just add more flour as you roll the skins.
          </li>
          <li>
            The traditional method is to make the center thicker than the ediges. You can see how Chinese usually do this in <a href="https://youtu.be/qWkvFssMz24">this video</a>. This results in thicker skins and a heavier potsticker. We prefer thinner skins, because it makes the potsticker lighter.

      <b>Filling and crimping the postickers</b>

      <p>
        This is very difficult to explain in writing. I recommend watching <a href="https://youtu.be/qWkvFssMz24">the Dumpling Sisters do it</a>. Start at 3:30.

        <b>Cooking the potstickers</b>

        <ol>
          <li>In a small glass, put half water and white vinegar.
          <li>
            Add a generous layer of cooking oil (NOT olive or any other flavored oil) to the skillet and heat to medium high or high heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Arrange dumplings in skillet in concentric circles and one or two in the cetner.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour vinegar-water mixture into pan (watch out for splattering!) and immediately cover with lid. Keep heat on high.
          </li>
          <li>
            Listen carefully. When the liquid has boiled off, you'll start to hear some crackling. Let it cook for another minute or two. Lift lid and slice into one of the dumplings. If it's not fully cooked, add a little more water and cover. When they're cooked, use a metal spatula to carefully scrape dumplings of the skillet bottom and place onto a large plate. Serve.
          </li>
        </ol>

          <li>
            Carefully dip each potstickers into the sauce and eat. They will be hot and slippery.

        <b>Making more:</b>
        
        <ol class="browser-default">
          <li>
            Host a party and train your guests to make the potstickers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep encouraging your guests, so they really get into it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook some periodically for the guests, so they can taste how good the potstickers are.
          </li>
          <li>
            You'll end up with way more potstickers than the guests can eat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place remaining uncooked dumplings on generously cookie sheets and put them into the freezer for about 30-60 minutes (longer is OK).
          </li>
          <li>
            You now have lots of premade dumplings that can be cooked and eaten any time. Just follow the exact cooking instructions above. Do not thaw them first.
