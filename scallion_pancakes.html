        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <ol class="browser-default">
          <li>
            First, make the dough. This is the most difficult step,
            because I don't know the exact amounts or proportions of flour and
            water. The
            goal is to make a dough that is similar in texture to bread dough
            but drier. The trick is to learn by trial and error. Do the rest of
            the steps and see how good the results are and adjust
            accordingly. Also, check to see whether there is too much or too
            little dough and adjust for the next time. In any case, you do
            roughtly the following: 
            <ol class="browser-default">
              <li>Put the flour in a large mixing bowl.
              <li> Add the water and mix first with a wooden spoon and then
                your hands.
              <li>Add water or dough according to whether the dough is too wet
                and sticky or too dry. Don't be afraid to switch if you've
                overadjusted one way or another.
              <li>Once the dough has the right texture, form into small balls
                about the size of a golf ball. Coat generously with flour.
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Generously coat a flat dry surface with flour.</li>
          <li>Roll one of the balls into a flat disk. It needn't be
            perfectly circular. The goal is to roll it as thin as possible.
            <ol class="browser-default">
              <li>If
                the dough is too wet or elastic, this won't work. This can be solved
                by just adding more flour to the flat surface as you roll the dough
                until its texture is still somewhat elastic but dry.
              </li>
              <li>If the dough has the right consistency, you will be able to
                apply a lot of pressure, almost all of your body weight, as you
                roll.
              </li>
              <li>Rotate the dough between rolls (or between every 2-3
                rolls), so that it maintains a roughly circular shape.
              </li>
              <li>Flip the dough occasionally, so both sides are similar in
                moisture or dryness.
              </li>
              <li>If a hole appears, try to pinch it shut and continue
                rolling. If a few small holes persist, just continue.
              <li>Ideally, you
                want the dough to be thin enough that you can see faintly the
                surface below. But if this is too hard to do the first few times,
                just continue with whatever you can do.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Adding the remaining ingredients:
            <ol class="browser-default">
              <li>Put the oil in a small bowl.</li>
              <li>Brush the top of the now thin dough generously with oil.</li>
              <li>Sprinkle some salt on the dough (on the surface of the oil).</li>
              <li>Sprinkle some but not too much chopped scallions on the the
                dough. Again, you'll figure out how much via trial and error.</li>
              <li>Now comes another tricky part. You want to slowly roll the dough
                as tightly as possible into a long thin cylinder with many layers of
                the dough with layers of oil, scallions, salt in between.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Creating the layers of the pancake:
            <ol class="browser-default">
              <li>Now, keeping the dough on the table, shape it back into a disk
                by forming a tight (horizontal) spiral disk. Mush it gently with
                your hand to flatten it a bit and tighten the spiral. As you reach
                the end of the cylinder, tuck the last bit under the spiral disk.
              </li>
              <li>Using the rolling pin, roll the disk formed by the spiral into a
                not-too-thin disk, say about a 1/4 inch thick. As you get
                better, you can make this thinner (but not too thin) to get a more
                flaky result.
              </li>
              <li>If you didn't make the spiral tight enough, it will separate
                as you roll it. Just reform the spiral and try again.
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Cooking the pancakes:
            <ol class="browser-default">
              <li>Heat the skillet to medium-high heat (yes, you'll adjust this
                as you make the pancakes).
              </li>
              <li>Add enough oil to coat the entire bottom with a not-too-thin
                layer.
              </li>
              <li>Fry the pancake on each side until both sides have nicely
                browned spots, where the pancake touches the pan, and feel or sound
                crispy.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Eating the pancakes
            <ol class="browser-default">
              <li>They should be eaten immediately.</li>
              <li>Slice into quarters or eighths and eat. The pieces might
                fall apart due to the spiral but that's OK.
              </li>
              <li>If you want, prepare the dipping sauce by mixing the
                ingredients in a small bowl.
              </li>
              <li>Adjust the proportion of soy sauce and vinegar according
                to taste.
              </li>
              <li>But if the amount of scallions and salt is
                just right and the pancake is nice and flaky, then it's delicious as
                is.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Making more:</li>
          <ol class="browser-default">
            <li>After you make one, you can adjust both the
              ingredients and the steps to improve the results. You'll also find
              that just by making more, the results improve, even if you didn't
              consciously change anything.
            </li>
            <li>Once you get good enough results, you can make several
              uncooked pancakes, coat each generously with flour, and stack them
            </li>
            <li>After you've made enough uncooked ones, you can fry them
              all up and serve each one as they are cooked.
            </li>
