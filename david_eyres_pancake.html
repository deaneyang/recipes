	 <p><span class="bold">Craig Claiborne described</span> making the acquaintance of the oven-baked pancake as if he had met Grace Kelly: “It was discovered some weeks ago at an informal Sunday brunch in the handsome, Japanese-style home of the David Eyres in Honolulu. With Diamond Head in the distance, a brilliant, palm-ringed sea below and this delicately flavored pancake before us, we seemed to have achieved paradise.”</p>
<p>Life was good if you were a food writer in the 1960s. Even when you made mistakes (Claiborne doubled the butter in his recipe), paradise never dimmed. Bloggers did not burn him at the stake. He was not dragged in shame through the corrections column. A few weeks later, he simply mentioned airily, “The food editor was in such reverie on his return from Hawaii he did not notice the gremlins in his measuring spoons.”</p>
<p>Forty years later, readers are still making that pancake (with less butter but no less bliss). It appears on a dozen blogs, embellished with family stories and photos and new-and-improved versions of the recipe. </p>
<p>What keeps cooks faithful to one recipe is often some confluence of ease and surprise. David Eyre’s pancake possesses both. A batter of flour, milk, eggs and nutmeg is blended together, then poured into a hot skillet filled with butter and baked. Anyone confused? I didn’t think so.</p>
<p>The surprise comes, appropriately, at the end, when you open the oven door to find a poofy, toasted, utterly delectable-looking pancake. This soon collapses as you shower it with confectioners’ sugar and lemon juice, slice it up and devour it. It’s sweet and tart, not quite a pancake and not quite a crepe. But lovable all the same. </p>
<p>I sent the recipe to Ana Sortun, the chef at Oleana in Cambridge, Mass., who tried it out with her cooks. “We thought if we were serving it for dessert, it would be a no-brainer,” she said. “We’d just sprinkle it with orange-flower water.” One cook spread it with pear butter, another with rose-petal jam, both with enthusiastic response.</p>
<p>But when it came to tweaking it, Sortun headed in another direction. Smitten with the pancake’s crisp, puffy and eggy qualities, she decided to play around with the idea of crossing a popover (puffy, eggy) with the Moroccan squab pie bisteeya (crisp). She seasoned the batter with cinnamon and nutmeg, then assembled a filling of shredded chicken, almonds, harissa, saffron and lemon. Instead of a skillet, she baked the popovers — she calls them dumplings — in muffin tins, changing the shape entirely. Like the skillet for the pancake, the muffin tin was preheated so the popovers would cook quickly, searing on the edges. </p>
<p>The batter toasts and swells and envelops the filling, a trifecta riff on popovers, dumplings and bisteeya. They deflate like pricked balloons, so their journey from the oven to the table must be quick. Sprinkle them with lemon juice and cilantro as you go. </p>

<p><span class="bold">1966: David Eyres Pancake</span></p>
<p>This recipe appeared in a Times article by Craig Claiborne.</p>
<p>2 eggs</p>
<p>½ cup flour</p>
<p>½ cup milk</p>
<p>Pinch of ground nutmeg</p>
<p>4 tablespoons butter</p>
<p>2 tablespoons confectioners’ sugar</p>
<p>Juice of half a lemon</p>
<p>Fig or blackberry jam, pear butter or any kind of marmalade, for serving (optional).</p>
<p>1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. In a mixing bowl, lightly beat the eggs. Add the flour, milk and nutmeg and lightly beat until blended but still slightly lumpy.</p>
<p>2. Melt the butter in a 12-inch skillet with a heatproof handle over medium-high heat. When very hot but not brown, pour in the batter. Bake in the oven until the pancake is billowing on the edges and golden brown, about 15 minutes.</p>
<p>3. Working quickly, remove the pan from the oven and, using a fine-meshed sieve, sprinkle with the sugar. Return to the oven for 1 to 2 minutes more. Sprinkle with lemon juice and serve with jam, pear butter or marmalade. <span class="italic">Serves 2 to 4.</span> </p>

<p><span class="bold">2007: Moroccan Chicken Dumplings</span></p>
<p>By Ana Sortun, the chef at Oleana in Cambridge and the author of “Spice: Flavors of the Eastern Mediterranean.”</p>
<p>Cooking-oil spray</p>
<p>¾ cup cooked, shredded chicken (from about half a chicken breast or 2 thighs)</p>
<p>1/3 cup slivered almonds, toasted</p>
<p>1 ½ teaspoons harissa</p>
<p>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</p>
<p>Salt</p>
<p>1 lemon</p>
<p>Pinch of saffron</p>
<p>½ cup flour</p>
<p>1/8 teaspoon nutmeg</p>
<p>1/8 teaspoon cinnamon</p>
<p>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</p>
<p>½ cup whole milk</p>
<p>4 tablespoons butter, melted</p>
<p>1 tablespoon finely chopped cilantro, to garnish</p>
<p>Chicken broth (optional).</p>
<p>1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Grease a muffin tin with 6 half-cup molds with cooking-oil spray. In a mixing bowl, combine the chicken, almonds, harissa and olive oil. Season with salt.</p>
<p>2. Juice half the lemon. Cut the remaining half into 6 wedges and set aside. In a small mixing bowl, dissolve the saffron in 2 teaspoons lemon juice; let sit for 10 minutes.</p>
<p>3. Place the muffin tin on a sheet pan and put it in the oven to heat, about 5 minutes. In another mixing bowl, combine the flour, nutmeg, cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Make a well in the center, add the eggs, milk and saffron mixture and beat gently, leaving the batter a little lumpy.</p>
<p>4. Remove the muffin tin from the oven and distribute the melted butter evenly among the molds. (It is important that each cup has enough butter, as the batter will fry in it when baked.) Divide the batter among the molds, no more than halfway up each. Drop about 2 tablespoons chicken filling into the center of each. Bake until the edges are browned and the batter is cooked through, 12 to 15 minutes. Top with cilantro and serve with lemon wedges. Eat as is or with homemade chicken broth poured on top. <span class="italic">Serves 6 as an appetizer; with broth, it would serve 2 or 3 as a main course. </span></p>
