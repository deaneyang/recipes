<I>Madeleines au Chocolat</i><P>

Madeleines are good any time, any where. Here are some secrets to making madeleines, and a wonderful
chocolate version which is guaranteed to please!
<P>
&#149; Make the dough up to three days in advance and chill it in the refrigerator.<BR>
&#149; Heavily butter the molds and chill them so the butter hardens
before the molds are filled with batter.<BR>
&#149; Refrigerate the filled molds before baking.<BR>
&#149; Make sure the oven
is fully hot before baking the madeleines.<BR>
&#149; Bake for no longer than 7 minutes &#151; the madeleines should not
quite spring back when you touch them. This ensures a moist result.
 
<P>

3/4 cup (100g) all-purpose flour<BR>
Half cup (90g) unsweetened cocoa <BR>
Pinch salt <BR>
4 large eggs <BR>
1 cup (200g) vanilla sugar <BR>
12 tablespoons (6 ounces; 185g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled <BR>
Butter for buttering the madeleine tins

<P>

1.  Sift together the flour, cocoa and the salt.<P>

2.  Place the eggs and the sugar in a large bowl or the bowl of an electric
mixer and whisk until thick and lemon-colored.  Fold in the flour, then
melted butter.<P>

3.  Butter the madeleine pans, then spoon in the batter, filling each about
three fourths full. Refrigerate the filled madeleine pans and the remaining
batter for one hour.<P>

4.  Heat the oven to 425&deg;F (220&deg;C).<P>

5.  Bake the madeleines just until they are firm and puffed, about 7
minutes. Turn them immediately from the molds, wipe out the molds, let cool
and continue baking the madeleines until all of the batter is used.  The
madeleines are best when eaten slightly warm or at room temperature the
same day they are made.
