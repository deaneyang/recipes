            Ingredients</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>2 cups of unbleached or bread flour (as a start</li>
            <li>Slightly less than 1 cup warm water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil (but not olive oil)</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h5>Instructions</h5>
        <ol class="browser-default">
          <li>
            Dump flour into a large bowl (could be a large salad spinner container or a large pot).
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat up water so that it's just barely warm and add oil to it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pour water/oil mixture into flour slowly while mixing. It should be clumpy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mix and knead vigorously the mixture in the bowl, scraping it off the bowl as needed. When the dough turns pliable and very slightly sticky and most of the flour is mixed into the dough, then it's about done. If it's too sticky, slowly sprinkle some flour while you knead it. 
            </li>
          <li>
            Cover the dough with a wet dishtowel and let it rest about 15--30 min. If the dough is dry, the dishtowel can touch it. If it's on the sticky side, just drape it on the rim of the bowl and above the dough.
          </li>
        </ol>
